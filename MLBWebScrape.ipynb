    "# Web Scraping 2024 MLB Data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Task at Hand:\n",
    "The goal of this project was to scrape MLB data from the 2024 season and do some basic analysis on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology:\n",
    "- **Tool**: The scraping process was automated using Selenium.\n",
    "- **Website Selection**: The MLB website was used due to ease of access. Ability to scrape was ensured beforehand through its robots.txt file.\n",
    "- **Function Definition**: A custom function was written to scrape player stats, using XPath to extract relevant data. This required inspecting each website's HTML structure to identify the correct XPath for each stat. \n",
    "- **Data Collection**: The function was applied to gather player stats and other performance indicators. After the scraping process, the data was converted into a Pandas DataFrame and saved as a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges:\n",
    "1. **Multiple Pages**: \n",
    "   - The MLB website's stats page only shows 25 players at a time. For this reason, I had to automate the process of going to the next page in addition to scraping each point of data. I then ran into the problem of having additional stats being hid behind an \"extended stats\" tab. This problem was solved in a similar fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multiple Dataframes**:\n",
    "    - After dealing with the extended stats problem, my resulting dataset was initally split so that the standard stats were collected first and then the extended stats, leaving a bunch of null values for the extended stats when standard stats were being collected and vice versa. To solve this, I put standard and extended stats in their own dataframes and then joined them for a final dataframe.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Messy Data**\n",
    "    - The resultant tables were relatively clean, but the player names needed a little cleaning. because they included the position of the player.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This project demonstrated how to extract relevant sports statistics using web scraping, clean the data into a structured format, and prepare it for further analysis by converting it into a CSV."
